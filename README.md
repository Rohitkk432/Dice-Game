## Rules:
1. This is a 2 player game.
2. When you roll the die the roll on top face is added to you score and you can keep rolling and increasing the score but if you get a "one" you lose all your points and the      die goes to other player.
3. So to avoid loss of points one can tap "hold" to add points from current score to total score and the die goes to the opponent.
4. First player to reach 100 points wins the game.
5. Tap on "New Game" to reset the game.
